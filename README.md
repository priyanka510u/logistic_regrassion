# Logistic_Regrassion

## Overview

This repository contains two machine learning projects utilizing logistic regression algorithms:

Loan Approval Prediction: A project that predicts loan approval status based on various financial and personal features.

Wine Data Classification: A project that classifies wine quality based on physicochemical properties using logistic regressionProject 

1: Loan Approval Prediction

#Description

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on the applicant's information. Features include financial details, personal information, and loan-related attributes.

2: Wine Type Prediction

#Description

This project aims to classify the type of wine based on various physicochemical properties using logistic regression. The dataset includes several attributes related to the wine's composition, and the objective is to predict the wine type
